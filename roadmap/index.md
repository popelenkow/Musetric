# Musetric Project Roadmap

This project uses agent-based workflow management system.

All tasks are located in the `roadmap/tasks/` folder and follow the workflow defined in [templates/workflow.md](./templates/workflow.md).

Agents work according to established templates and rules to ensure consistent task execution and documentation.
